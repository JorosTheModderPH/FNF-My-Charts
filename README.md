# FNF-My-Charts
My FNF Charts. 


This is all of my charts in fnf, and I put effort into it.

If you want to download my charts use [DownGit](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home)

Here is the tutorial if you want to use DownGit:

Go to DownGit, type in your URL, and click "Download"! You can also change the attributes of the downloaded file if you know what you're doing. The fundamental method is as follows:

1. Take the directory link (angular-route was used), 
2. Go to the GitHub API. 
3. Search the directory for all files and download them all.
